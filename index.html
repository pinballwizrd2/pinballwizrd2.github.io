<h1>The landscaping industry of today will soon fall under stress as a bulge of baby boomers reach retirement age, and in increasing frequency, to increasing
numbers of people, the question will form of whether or not hiring professional landscapers to complete regular landscaping service on their properties
is consistently satisfying for the cost they must be incurred for it to be done. The incentive to hire others for outdoor work increases for more people.

<p> Any agreement of the amount of favors to be owed to any one person or group of people through a society's monetary system relies on scarcity. 
  Agreement relies on scarcity. There must be a definite number of considered opinion-givers whose opinions can be shown to be unanimous for 
  agreement to happen, otherwise no number of stated opinions could be used to draw a conclusion about whether agreement has been reached for any relevant idea. </p>
  
  <h2>Solution?</h2>
  
<p> Since the invention of public key cryptography, several suitable mathematical functions, such as prime number exponentiation and elliptic curve multiplication, have
  been discovered. These mathematical functions are practically irreversible, meaning that they are easy to calculate in one direction and infeasible to calculate in 
  the opposite direction. Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures. Bitcoin uses 
  elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its cryptography. The method of hashing transactions into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record
  that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work, created with Bitcoin's publication at the turn of 2009.
